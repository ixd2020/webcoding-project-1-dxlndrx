        <b>Salvador Dalí</b> was born on 11 May 1904, in Spain. He is known as a famous Surrealist artist, influential for his eccentric behaviour and bizarre explorations of subconscious imagery.

        At an early age, Salvador Dali's parents sent him to an art school in Figueres, Spain. In 1922, Dalí moved to Madrid where he received his formal education in fine arts at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. He was influenced by Impressionism and Renaissance, thereafter attracted to Cubism and avant-garde movements. Dali visited Paris where he met Pablo Picasso whom he revered and learnt much from.

        With time, his painting style evolved and from 1929 to 1937, he produced paintings which made him the world’s best-known Surrealist artist. He depicted a dream world in which objects are juxtaposed, deformed or metamorphosed in a bizarre and irrational fashion.
        Dali became known for his bizarre images. Being eccentric by nature, his critics were irritated by his weird antics and outrageous behaviour and public actions.

        Dali's most famous work of art is <span class="coloured-title"><a href="famouspaintings.html#the_persistence_of_memory">The Persistence of Memory (1931)</a></span>, in which it depicts a human-like figure sleeping amongst melting clocks in a deserted  landscape. His other well-known paintings include “The Metamorphosis of Narcissus”, “The Burning Giraffe”, “Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening” and “The Great Masturbator”.

        Besides painting, Dali also spent much of his time producing sculptures, designing furniture, jewellery and publishing books. He designed shop windows for Fifth Avenue. He had many collaborations for commercials with big brand names like De Beers. He worked on two Hollywood films (Alfred Hitchcock’s Spellbound, 1945, and Walt Disney’s Destino, 1945, released in 2003). He also worked with many famous people like Coco Chanel and Christian Dior.
        He appeared in television advertisements, designed magazine covers and collaborated with the iconic photographer Philippe Halsman. His repertoire is amazing!

        Dali's art uses symbols such as melting clocks, ants, eggs and elephants.

        There are two major museums devoted to Salvador Dalí's work: the Dalí Theatre-Museum in Figueres, Spain, and the Salvador Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida.

        Dali suffered from depression, severe undernourishment and eventually died of heart failure at the age of 84. From his many quotes that he live by in his lifetime, Dali was a self proclaimed genius who is revered for his paintings even till today. Eccentric as he may be, he has influenced society in many ways and still lives on in many of our hearts.
