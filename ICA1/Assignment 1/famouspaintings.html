              This painting depicts clocks melting on a deserted landscape. The contrasting use of hard and soft represents the realities of the world. It can be interpreted like the human mind moving from the softness of sleep to the hardness of reality. The melting clocks are an unconscious symbol of the relativity of space and time, especially when we are dreaming. The ants symbolise decay, with how we keep track of time in our daily lives. The Persistence of Memory is considered one of the greatest masterpieces of twentieth century art. It is not only the most famous painting of Salvador Dali but also the most renowned artwork in Surrealism.

              This painting uses the reflection in a lake to create a double image. The three swans in front of the trees are reflected in the lake so that their necks become the elephants’ trunks and the trees become the legs of the elephants. Swans Reflecting Elephants is considered a landmark painting in Surrealism as it enhanced the popularity of the double-image style. It is the most famous double image created by Salvador Dali; his greatest masterpiece using the paranoiac-critical method; and one of the most well-known works in Surrealism.

              Salvador Dali suffered from anxiety and had a premonition that a war was impending, due to “the prophetic power of his subconscious mind”. He painted this masterpiece six months before the Spanish Civil War began. It portrays two bodies fighting. The monstrous creature is self-destructive just as a civil war is. The boiled beans referred to the simple stew eaten by the poor during that difficult time. Soft Construction with Boiled Beans is renowned for brilliant use of surrealism to depict the horrors of war.</p>

              This painting shows Narcissus, renowned for his beauty, falling in love with his own reflection in the water. Salvador Dali used the paranoiac-critical method to tap into his subconscious through systematic irrational thought and a self-induced paranoid state. This technique in Surrealism was developed by Salvador Dali in the early 1930s. Metamorphosis of Narcissus was created by Dali during his paranoiac-critical period and is among his most renowned works using the technique.

            THE GREAT MASTURBATOR
          </h4>
          <p style="color: #282828;text-align: justify-all;margin-bottom: 3px;">
            This is Dali’s most controversial painting. It reflects the erotic transformation that he underwent upon Gala's arrival into his life.  This painting depicts Dali himself sleeping, and from his head, an erotic fantasy of a nude female figure, probably depicting Gala. He also drew fish-hook, the bleeding cuts, ants crawling on his face and a grasshopper. This is viewed by many as a bizarre self-portrait. The Great Masturbator is renowned for glorifying something that is usually ridiculed

          </h4>
          <p style="color: #282828;text-align: justify-all;margin-bottom: 3px;">
            This painting of his wife, Gala, was inspired by nuclear physics and the theories of disintegration of the atom. Her face is made up of many spheres, representing atomic particles, giving it a three dimensional effect. It depicts the disintegration of multiple atoms. Salvador Dali also used ideas from modern science to understand Christianity. Galatea of the Spheres is one of the most renowned paintings from Dali’s Nuclear Mysticism period.

          <p style="color: #282828;text-align: justify-all;margin-bottom: 3px;">
            The inspiration of this painting came to Salvador Dali through a cosmic dream. The composition consists of a triangle, reference to the Holy Trinity, formed by the arms of Christ and the horizontal of the cross. The circle, formed by the head of Christ, represents unity. This crucifix does not show any nails and blood as Dali felt would ruin his depiction of Christ. This painting was considered by many to be the greatest religious painting of the twentieth century.

          </h4>
          <p style="color: #282828;text-align: justify-all;margin-bottom: 3px;">
            This painting shows Salvador Dali's wife, Gala, sleeping on a rock. Her dream shows a pomegranate releasing a giant red fish and two ferocious tigers coming out from its mouth. This painting was intended “to express for the first time in images Freud’s discovery of the typical dream with a lengthy narrative, the consequence of the instantaneousness of a chance event which causes the sleeper to wake up.” The elephant, is a distorted version of Elephant and Obelisk, a sculpture by famous Italian artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini.

          <p style="color: #282828;text-align: justify-all;margin-bottom: 3px;">
            The Burning Giraffe depicts Salvador Dali's personal struggle during the civil war. It shows two feminine figures with protrusions from their backs. There are opened drawers on the leg and chest of the figure, probably influenced by Sigmund Freud, a famous neurologist. These open drawers are associated with the inner, subconscious within man. The burning giraffe in the background is believed to be a premonition of war.
